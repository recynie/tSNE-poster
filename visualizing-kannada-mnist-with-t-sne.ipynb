We used PCA for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset. PCA essentially tries project the original data onto the directions where variance is maximum. In our case it projcected the data onto 2 Dimensions which could then be easily visualised.\n","\n","However, the visualisations produced by PCA was not able to do such a good job in differentiating all the digits.This is because PCA is a **linear projection**, which means it can’t capture non-linear dependencies. In this notebook we shall explore another Dimensionality reduction technique called **t-SNE** and see if it gives us better results as compared to PCA\n","<hr>\n","<div align='left'><font size=\"4\" color=\"#FFA500\">Part2: t-SNE(T-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding) in Python</font></div>\n","<hr>\n","\n","## Table of Contents\n","\n","* What is t-SNE\n","* Embeddings]\n","* t-SNE under the hood\n","* t-SNE with Scikit learn\n","* Interactively visualising t-SNE with Bokeh\n","* Further Readings\n","\n","\n","\n","## <a name=\"tsne\"></a>t-SNE\n","\n","**t-SNE** or **T-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding** takes a high dimensional data set and reduces it to a low dimensional graph that retains a lot of the original information. It does so by giving each data point a location in a two or three-dimensional map. This technique finds clusters in data thereby making sure that an embedding preserves the meaning in the data. \n","t-SNE reduces dimensionality while trying to keep similar instances close and dissimilar instances apart. \n","\n","## <a name=\"embeddings\"></a>Embeddings\n","An **embedding** is essentially a low-dimensional space into which a high dimensional vector can be translated. During translation, an embedding preserves the semantic relationship of the inputs by placing similar inputs close together in the embedding space. Let’s try and wrap our head around this concept with examples. Here is a grab from the creators of the [Embedding projector](https://projector.tensorflow.org/), a tool which enables us to visualise high dimensional data easily.\n","\n","<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/340677521\" width=\"640\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n","<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/340677521.mp4\">Embeddings</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user97669696\">Parul Pandey</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n","\n","## t-SNE under the hood\n","**t-SNE**, was proposed by Geoffry Hinton’s and Laurens van der Maaten  back in 2008. Their paper titled [Visualizing Data using t-SNE](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf) is an essential read for soembody trying to understand t-SNE. Here is how t-SNE basically works:\n","\n","1.  First, a probability distribution is created in a high dimensional space. This means if we pick a point in the dataset, we define the probability of picking another point as a neighbour.\n","2. Next, a low dimensional space is then created that has the same(or as near as possible) probability distribution as the high Dimensional space.\n","\n","## t-SNE with Scikit learn\n","\n","Scikit-learn has an implementation of t-SNE available, and you can check its documentation [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html). \n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n","# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n","\n","import os\n","for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n","    for filename in filenames:\n","        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n","\n","# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a"},"source":["### Loading the necessary libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from time import time\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","\n","# For plotting\n","from matplotlib import offsetbox\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import matplotlib.patheffects as PathEffects\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import plotly.graph_objects as go\n","\n","%matplotlib inline\n","sns.set(style='white', context='notebook', rc={'figure.figsize':(14,10)})\n","\n","#For standardising the dat\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","\n","#PCA\n","from sklearn.manifold import TSNE\n","\n","#Ignore warnings\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Reading in the data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["train=  pd.read_csv('../input/Kannada-MNIST/train.csv')\n","test=  pd.read_csv('../input/Kannada-MNIST/test.csv')\n","\n","train.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Setting the label and the feature columns"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["y = train.loc[:,'label'].values\n","x = train.loc[:,'pixel0':].values\n","\n","print(x.shape)\n","print(y)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["## Plotting the original train data\n","\n","def plot_digits(data):\n","    fig, axes = plt.subplots(4, 10, figsize=(10, 4),\n","                             subplot_kw={'xticks':[], 'yticks':[]},\n","                             gridspec_kw=dict(hspace=0.1, wspace=0.1))\n","    for i, ax in enumerate(axes.flat):\n","        ax.imshow(data[i].reshape(28, 28),\n","                  cmap='binary', interpolation='nearest',\n","                  clim=(0, 16))\n","plot_digits(x)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["## Standardizing the data\n","standardized_data = StandardScaler().fit_transform(x)\n","print(standardized_data.shape)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# t-SNE is consumes a lot of memory so we shall use only a subset of our dataset. \n","\n","x_subset = x[0:10000]\n","y_subset = y[0:10000]\n","\n","print(np.unique(y_subset))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Applyting t-SNE on the data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["%time\n","tsne = TSNE(random_state = 42, n_components=2,verbose=0, perplexity=40, n_iter=300).fit_transform(x_subset)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Here is a brief explanation of the parameter.\n","\n","* **n_components (default: 2)**: Dimension of the embedded space.\n","* **verbose (default: 0)** : Verbosity level.\n","* **perplexity (default: 30)**: The perplexity is related to the number of nearest neighbors that are used in other manifold learning algorithms.
